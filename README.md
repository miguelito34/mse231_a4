# Surveys, Tests, and Sampling Bias on Amazon Mechanical Turk

### Overview
Following along with the [MS&E 231 class website](https://5harad.com/mse231/#hw4), we'll be conducting a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk and correcting sampling biases before analyzing the survey results.

### Getting Set Up
1. Clone the GitHub repo into a directory of your choosing. You can name the directory whatever you'd like.
```
mkdir <your new folder>
cd <your new folder>
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:miguelito34/mse231_a4.git
git pull origin master
```

The first time you go to push a file, you may receive this note:
```
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master
```

If you see that, push using the instructions as above:
```
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

From now on, anytime you need to make changes, you should be able to push using:
```
git push
```
